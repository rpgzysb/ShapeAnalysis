# ShapeAnalysis

Implementation of Shape Analysis based on the paper [Parametric shape analysis via 3-valued logic](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjstdGEytTVAhUV2GMKHchoC58QFghCMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.wisc.edu%2Fwpis%2Fpapers%2Ftoplas02.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHyPC9wdWFgqA3A3XOEvyCli8RNUg).
The code contains only the architecture for the analysis framework and some basic analysis facilities. 
The Focus, Blur and Coerce parts are still unfinished.
